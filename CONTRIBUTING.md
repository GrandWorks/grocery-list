## I know of a shop that is open

If you know of a shop that is open we'd like you to do two things:

1. Double check the [website](http://goaforyou.in/) to make sure that it isn't already there.
2. Call the number you are about add and make sure that it is valid and is indeed a shop.

Once you've done these things head on over to [this form](http://goaforyou.in/) and add all the details that you can. Our volunteers will go through it and it to the website as soon as the can.

## A shop that you've listed is incorrect

These things happen sometimes. Shops that were functional a day ago stop accepting calls when their stock runs out. We want to know when this happens so that we can keep our data up to date.

Use the leave feedback link to let us know what is wrong with this entry.

## I saw an technical issue on the website

We list all our technical issues on Github. You can see the [list](https://github.com/wazidshah/grocery-list/issues/) and check if someone has already reported it, if not, feel free to [open a new issue](https://github.com/wazidshah/grocery-list/issues/new).

## I can help with the website code

Check out the Development section of the [README](https://github.com/wazidshah/grocery-list#development) to see how to setup the code on your machine. PRs are welcome, we'll try to review as soon as we can.

## I can curate, organize and clean up the data

We are using Google Sheets to collect and organize the data.

### Data

* [Main shops data sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dYhgURRKD2-JW4T98w-VAeP5IgJU0p9KPDN_RbRIryE/edit#gid=0) (curated and organized by volunteers)
* [Crowdsourced shops data sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dRBEj17BkXIUTdzRKyRyDYITfn9Kb0hhuzGP8d5hEeg/edit#gid=1492144702) (collected using this [form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dRBEj17BkXIUTdzRKyRyDYITfn9Kb0hhuzGP8d5hEeg/edit#gid=1492144702))

### Process

The crowdsourced shops data is processed by volunteers and then copied to the main sheet. A few things to keep in mind when doing this:

1. Shop type should be lowercase
2. If a shop has multiple types it should be separated by a slash ‚Äî `/`.
3. Shop type should only be one of these:
 * Medical
 * Grocery
 * Milk
 * Vegetables
 * Fish & Meat
 * Veteniary
4. If a shop has multiple phone numbers it should be separated by a slash ‚Äî `/`.
5. Always go sequentially when moving the data and announce on WhatsApp that you're about to do some migration.
6. The row that is marked <span style="background:yellow">yellow</span> is the last one that was transferred to the main sheet. Start after that.
7. When working on moving some rows to the main sheet, make sure to color them <span style="background:cyan">cyan</span> so others know you're working on them. You can make them white once you're done.
8. After moving those rows, mark the next one with <span style="background:yellow">yellow</span> so that the other volunteers know till which row the data has been moved.
9. If you find any data that you __dont__ transfer to the main sheet, whether it was because the data has errors, or if you think the categories aren't correct, make sure to mark them in <span style="background:red">red</span>. Someone else (@wazidshah) will look at them and decide what to do.
10. Once you're done migrating a few rows make sure the ones you're done are white again and that you've marked the last one that was done as <span style="background:yellow">yellow</span>. Also, announce on WhatsApp that you're done.
